// Verifier for Anon's bank. Discovered by scripts/verify-all.mjs.
//
// Per authoring rule 3 this RECOMPUTES and trusts no stored field: the closed
// count, the forced-word cold start, the cell partition, the spine, the category
// sharpness and the spellings are all re-derived from `q` and `a` alone. The
// stored `closed` and `forced` numbers are then checked AGAINST the recomputed
// ones, so a board whose metadata drifted fails rather than passing on its own
// say-so.
//
// FLOORS (documented here because a rule that is not written down is not a rule):
//
//   partition    every answer's letters sit at its own cells, and the cells of
//                all answers cover 0..n-1 exactly once. This is what makes the
//                two halves the same letters, so it is not negotiable.
//   spine        the first `spine` answers' initials spell `author` exactly.
//   sharpness    a printed category admits at most CAND_CAP words at that
//                length across the whole category lexicon. A looser category is
//                noise printed as help.
//   closed       at least CLOSED_MIN answers carry a category.
//   cold start   at least FORCED_PCT of the passage's words become uniquely
//                determined by the closed answers' letters alone. This is the
//                measure of whether the board can be started at all, and it is
//                the one that must never be relaxed to fit a board.
//   spelling     US forms only.
//   variety      no answer repeated within a board; no answer used more than
//                WORD_CAP times across the bank; no author more than AUTHOR_CAP.
//   sunday       a board flagged sunday lands on a real Sunday and runs longer
//                than the weekday median.
//   ramp         the cold start descends across the week: Monday is the way in,
//                Sunday is the wall. Each weekday carries a BAND rather than a
//                floor, because a floor alone lets every board pile up against
//                it and the ramp flattens (rule 11, a floor is not a target).
//
// Boards live before ANON_FLOOR_FROM are frozen history and skip the floors,
// and boards before ANON_RAMP_FROM skip the band on top of that.

// The bank was re-dated into these bands the day they were written; nothing
// was re-authored, because the 54 banked boards already spanned 34 to 72% and
// the old 32% floor was the only rule, so warmth landed on the calendar at
// random (one week ran 42/41/40/40/39/39, six of the coldest boards back to

//
// SUNDAY has two dials, length and coldness, and it already runs a third longer

// to 65%: a Sunday slot needs a Sunday board, so they can only trade with each
// other, and they are ordered to ramp into place rather than being rewritten.
