// Verify the Junkyard (8x8 sliding-block jam, the top rung of the family) bank.
//
// This is verify-impound.mjs's twin, bound to Junkyard's board. It checks the
// same claims because Junkyard makes the same claims, and it asserts two more:
// that Junkyard is genuinely the BIGGEST game, so every weekday rung sits above
// the Impound rung it corresponds to, and that the FAMILY LADDER the end card
// hands players along is intact in every roster that reads it (check 10).
//
// Junkyard's own header (app/junkyard/puzzles.js) and its solver binding
// (app/junkyard/solver.js) promise, per puzzle:
//   - the board is eight by eight with the exit on row 4. Eight is even, so
//     there is no true middle rank and the lane has to lean: four ranks of
//     traffic above it and three below, the opposite lean to Parker's 6x6.
//     Eight is also the LAST rung possible, because lib/jam-core packs
//     occupancy into two 32-bit words and 64 cells is the ceiling;
//   - block 0 is always RED: two long, horizontal, fixed on the exit row,
//     escaping through the gap in the right-hand wall on that row;
//   - `par` (the field's old name, kept so it matches Impound's shape; the game
//     calls this PERFECT) is the EXACT minimum number of moves, found by
//     breadth-first search over the whole reachable state space, not an
//     estimate;
//   - the week climbs in two rungs, each dialed differently: Monday to
//     Wednesday run perfect 22-35, Thursday to Saturday 31-47, and Sundays
//     44-80, with par non-decreasing across the whole Mon->Sat run of a week.
//
//   1. Structural: `grid(pieces)` is non-null (no overlapping or off-board
//      blocks); block 0 has len 2, is horizontal, and is fixed on row
//      EXIT_ROW (4); the start position is not already solved.
//   2. Full independent BFS solve via `solve()`: the recomputed minimum move
//      count must equal the stored `par` exactly. This alone proves both "not
//      fewer" and "not more", since solve() returns the true shortest path
//      length. Note that every banked board was ACCEPTED by the generator only
//      because its search reached the goal inside a 40,000-state cap, so this
//      re-solve is cheap by construction; a board that needs a big search here
//      did not come from the generator.
//   3. Rung bounds, and the sunday flag matching the real day of week.
//   4. Within-week ramp: par is non-decreasing across consecutive weekdays in
//      the same week (never wrapping Sat to Mon, skipping Sundays, which run
//      their own track). A flat step is a note rather than a failure.
//   5. quizId/num/live/dateLabel mutually consistent and sequential.
//   6. No duplicate boards (identical `pieces`).
//   7. Pool variety: the non-red blocks are hashed into a position-independent
//      signature, and any repeat is a hard fail. That space is huge (about
//      twenty blocks each with a length, an orientation, a row-or-column and an
//      offset), so a collision is real evidence of a copy-pasted board.
//   8. JUNKYARD IS BIGGER THAN IMPOUND, checked rather than asserted: every rung
//      band sits strictly above Impound's matching band, Junkyard's easiest
//      board is harder than Impound's Monday CEILING so the two weeks do not
//      overlap at the bottom, and Junkyard's MEDIAN board beats Impound's on
//      both tracks.
//
//      NOTE WHICH CLAIM THIS IS, because it is deliberately weaker than the one
//      verify-impound makes and the difference is a finding rather than a
//      slackening. Impound could assert "my Monday opens where Parker's week
//      ends" because its Monday floor (16) equals the floor of Parker's hardest
//      weekday rung (16) exactly. Junkyard cannot: repeating that step would put
//      its Monday at 28 and, compounding through the within-week floor, its
//      Saturday in the mid forties and its Sunday floor near 50 against a
//      MEASURED climb ceiling of about 54. Impound's bank already taught this
//      lesson from the other end, where a Sunday floor set near the ceiling made
//      each Sunday a coin toss and had to be measured down twice. So the ladder's
//      step shortens at the third rung, on purpose, and this check asserts what
//      is true of the bank rather than what would have been tidy.
//      Note what this deliberately does NOT claim: that every Junkyard board
//      beats every Impound board. Junkyard's Monday band overlaps Impound's
//      Thu-Sat band by design, because opening the week where the other game
//      finishes its is the whole point of a ladder. The Impound version of this
//      check was written too strong TWICE and failed a good bank both times;
//      it compares like with like, median against median.
//   9. US spelling: no reader-facing prose fields exist on a Junkyard puzzle
//      today, so this is a no-op scan kept for parity and for any future field.
//  10. THE FAMILY LADDER IS INTACT. Parker, Impound and Junkyard are handed to
//      each other as "up next" through GAME_FAMILIES in lib/daily-games.js, and
//      the pick resolves each key against a roster before offering it. A key
//      missing from a roster is therefore dropped SILENTLY: the ladder just
//      skips that rung, with no error anywhere, which is the exact failure mode
//      the daily-game registries checklist exists for. So every family member
//      must be present in lib/daily-games.js AND in app/DailyEndCard.jsx (the
//      second, independent roster that app/useNextUnplayed.js actually reads),
//      and the ladder must be in ascending board size, since that ordering is
//      what makes it a ramp rather than a set.
