//
// Everything here is RECOMPUTED from the board, never read back off the row.
//
// ⚠️ REWRITTEN A THIRD TIME 2026-08-11, and this rewrite THROWS OUT THE PLAYER
// MODELS ENTIRELY. The history matters because all three previous versions failed
// the same way in progressively better disguises:
//
//   ROUND ONE gated on a careful greedy bot. A 300-wide beam planner cleared 63
//   of the 70 boards it approved.
//   ROUND TWO gated on that beam. The same beam at width 2000 cleared 90% of what
//   it passed.
//   ROUND THREE dropped the bot gate for two BOARD properties, spare squares and
//   forgiveness. The owner cleared the first board of that bank first try, having
//   barely thought about it.
//
// Round three's boards were not soft on their own terms: EIGHT more player models
// written against them on 2026-08-11 (greedy, greedy plus strand check, a
// wall-hugging sweeper, a straight-preferring reflex player, one and two mascots
// of lookahead) all clear them roughly 0% of the time. Twelve models across four
// rounds, every one failing a board a person walks through without thinking.
//
// That is the finding: A BOT IS NOT THE THING THE BOARD IS SHOWN TO. A myopic
// model optimises the next square. A person sees a 7x7 grid whole and reads the
// route off it before moving. No cheap model does that, so every gate built on
// one measures the wrong species and normalises the bank to "just beats this
// week's bot".
//
// So this checker gates on THE SHAPE OF THE SOLUTION, which is what a person
// actually reads:
//
//   MAX LEG. The longest hop between consecutive mascots. A long hop across open
//   board is a CORRIDOR, not a decision. The generator this replaces MAXIMISED
//   leg length, because the Manhattan leg sum is a lower bound on coverage and a
//   high one forces the player to fill the board. It worked, and it is exactly
//   what made the boards readable: measured over the bank it replaces, mean
//   longest leg 10.2 out of a possible 12, mascots in opposite corners, and the
//   route a lap around the rim. Coverage now comes from the NUMBER of legs
//   instead, which is what the cast of 8-11 is for.
//
//   DETOUR, min - floor. How many moves the true optimum spends above the
//   Manhattan lower bound, i.e. how far you are forced to walk AWAY from the
//   mascot you are chasing. It was ZERO on 60 of the 67 boards this replaces:
//   every leg a plain monotone staircase, nothing anywhere counterintuitive.
//
//   TURN DENSITY, on the TIDIEST optimum. Squares per straight run. A route that
//   runs in long straight lines is a low-information object you take in at a
//   glance whatever its other statistics say. It is measured over the STRAIGHTEST
//   of all shortest routes, never whichever one the solver returned first: a board
//   can hold both a tangled optimum and a straight one and the player walks
//   whichever they find. Gating on an arbitrary route let three boards through at
//   3.0+ during this rebuild.
//
// The old player models are still RUN, at the bottom, and still print. They gate
// nothing. They are kept because a board a myopic line can finish is trivial by
// inspection and worth knowing about, not because passing them means anything.
//
// The claims checked, in order:
//   shape       row shape, the weekday ramp, cast rules, pellet placement
//   floor       the stored floor really is the Manhattan leg sum
//   findable    an independent exhaustive search finds the optimum, and
//               lib/chomp-engine replays it move for move
//   sunday      the flag matches the calendar, and Sunday is the peak rung
//   geometry    max leg, detour, turn density: the solution is not readable
//   ramp        spare squares fall Monday to Sunday, and the cast climbs
//   variety     start squares, mascot squares and cast orders spread out
//   scoring     partial credit behaves at every cast length

// REBUILT_FROM and WALLED_FROM are the played 10-day open-board remnant: they
// keep their old per-board gates, but the BANK-SHAPE checks (falling weekly
// means, variety pools, the Sunday peak) run on the LIVING era only, because

// THE WEEKDAY RAMP, indexed by getUTCDay so index 0 is Sunday.
//
// Two dials rise together through the week: the CAST (more mascots is more legs,
// more solid obstacles, and more of the board consumed) and the DETOUR. Spare
// squares fall, as before. Every band was MEASURED against what the generator can
// actually reach before it was written down, because round one wrote bands about
// twenty points below the achievable ceiling and that is how a Monday ended up
// handing out twenty-four free squares.
//
// The whole week is 7x7. Coverage no longer needs a big board to be forced: ten
// short legs reach the same floor as six long ones.
// TIGHTENED AGAIN 2026-08-11, same day, after the owner played the first bank at
// these settings and said it still looked easy. Both dials moved to the measured
// edge instead of a comfortable middle: the detour floor from 2 to 4, and turn
// density from 2.8 to 2.4. A floor of 2 on a 41-move route is about 5% of the
// board asking anything of you, which is a walk with two speed bumps.
//
// The floor is 4 and not 5 because 5 was MEASURED as unreachable at Saturday's
// rung and marginal on Sunday. A band nobody can hit is not a stricter gate, it
// is a build that starves and gets quietly relaxed later.
//
// FRIDAY IS CAST 9, not 10. At cast 10 with spare 4-5 the rung is essentially
// empty: of 27,000 boards in that spare band, eleven reached detour 4 and none
// survived the turn-density cap. Spare 4-5 means min 43-44, detour 4 means
// floor <= 39-40, and ten legs cannot be that short without the optimum
// collapsing back onto the floor. Saturday is TIGHTER and therefore easier to
