// Generate new Warmer boards and append them to app/warmer/puzzles.js.
//
// WHAT A WARMER BOARD IS. One secret word a day. `order` is EVERY VOCAB index
// sorted by cosine similarity to that word, most-similar first, so order[0] is
// the answer itself and the client turns a guess into a rank by looking up its
// position. The answer is never stored as a string. That means a board is not
// a combinatorial object you can search for: it is 32,300 real similarity
// numbers, and they have to come from the real model or the game lies to the
// player about what is close to what.
//
// WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM. GloVe 6B 100d NATIVE vectors, exactly as the
// bank header and CLAUDE.md ("Regenerating a Warmer order") state. Stanford and
// HuggingFace are not reachable from the sandbox; registry.npmjs.org is, and
// `wink-embeddings-sg-100d` ships those very vectors as JSON. Despite the name
// it is GloVe 6B 100d: 341,479 words, `{ vectors: word -> [...100 dims, l2norm,
// index] }`, and its "the" row is byte-for-byte Stanford's glove.6B.100d "the".
// All 32,300 VOCAB words have a native vector in it — none has to be bridged or
// synthesized, which is the failure the July 2026 rebuild existed to remove.
//
//   npm pack wink-embeddings-sg-100d          # ~118MB tarball
//   tar xzf wink-embeddings-sg-100d-*.tgz     # ~307MB package/…json
//
// This script does both itself if the JSON is not already at $WARMER_EMB (or
// the default cache path below), then streams it — never JSON.parse of 307MB —
// pulling out only the 32,300 vectors VOCAB needs.
//
// PROOF THE PIPELINE IS THE ORIGINAL ONE. `--reproduce` recomputes the order of
// every FROZEN board from these vectors and diffs it against what shipped:
//
//   60 of the 74 frozen boards reproduce with ZERO differences.
//   The other 14 differ only in adjacent transpositions — 350 misplaced slots
//   out of 2,390,200 (0.0146%), every one of them a swap of two neighbouring
//   words whose cosine differs by less than 4.3e-8, i.e. last-bits rounding in
//   whatever numeric library the July 2026 rebuild summed with. Not one
//   mismatch is anything but an adjacent pair, and none is in a board's hot
//   zone in a way a player could feel.
//
// So new boards are on the same scale and from the same source as the frozen
// ones. Run --reproduce after ANY change here; if it stops reporting
// adjacent-only mismatches, the vectors or the metric have drifted and the bank
// would silently change difficulty. (Over the EXTENDED bank the same command
// reports 122/136 exact: the 62 boards this script wrote reproduce bit-for-bit,
// and the 350 residual slots are all still in those same 14 old boards.)
//
// HOW AN ANSWER IS CHOSEN. Not by search — by a hand-curated POOL below, every
// entry an ordinary word a general audience knows, each tagged with its part of
// speech and a broad semantic domain. The pool is deliberately far larger than
// the run needs (about 356 weekday and 125 Sunday words survive vetting for a
// 53/9 run) so the ceilings below have room to bite instead of just barely
// being satisfiable. On top of the tags, five machine gates run over the real
// vectors:
//
//   1. RANK BAND. Weekday answers land in vocab rank 460-3600 (the frozen bank
//      ran 453-3534). Sunday answers land past 5030 — verify-warmer's
//      RARE_FLOOR is 5000, and a floor is not a target, so both bands are split
//      into three sub-bands the run must spread across rather than parking just
//      above the floor: weekday 460-1200 / 1200-2300 / 2300-3600, Sunday
//      5030-6000 / 6000-7000 / 7000-9000.
//   2. PROPER-NOUN / NEIGHBOURHOOD GATE. At least 13 of an answer's top 15
//      neighbours must be real dictionary words (public/crux-words.txt). This
//      is the "eyeball the top 15" gate from CLAUDE.md turned into a check: it
//      is what rejects telescope (hubble, keck), beach (florida, newport),
//      apple (intel, dell, macintosh), chase (morgan, stanley), bell (smith,
//      johnson, shaw) and button (jenson, brawn). NECESSARY, NOT SUFFICIENT —
//      every survivor was then read with its neighbours in front of it, and
//      that pass is what cut hole (putt, birdie, bogey — golf), seat
//      (constituency, elected), memory (disk, computer), magnet (magnet
//      school), basket (layup, dunk), turf (racetrack) and a dozen more whose
//      hot zone is a different sense of the word than the player will assume.
//      There is no way to automate that; do it again for anything you add.
//   3. SEMANTIC SEPARATION, which is this game's real pool-variety rule, since
//      "domain" for a word game is ultimately a fact about vectors and not
//      about a label someone typed. Two floors, because the two jobs differ:
//        - past rank 150 in every OTHER NEW answer's order, both directions;
//        - past rank  80 in every FROZEN answer's order, both directions.
//      Per-board legality cannot see that the frozen bank already ran gold and
//      diamond as each other's #2 neighbour, mountain and canyon at #2, guitar
//      and piano at #3 — and that its MEDIAN board sits only 58 ranks from its
//      nearest other answer, with 38 of 74 inside 60. This segment does not do
//      that to itself or to the past. It also cannot promise a 300 floor
//      against a past that dense: at 300 the run dies after 30 boards, because
//      74 frozen answers have already claimed most of the ordinary semantic
//      space. 80 against the past is roughly 1.4x its own median and was the
//      widest floor that still reached 2026-11-30 without padding the pool with
//      words nobody would enjoy guessing.
//   4. NO REPEATED ANSWER (which verify-warmer also enforces) and no repeated
//      word FAMILY: no answer contains another or shares its five-letter
//      prefix, across the whole bank. Cosine does not catch this — "joy" and
//      "enjoy" cleared the rank floor comfortably and still landed on
//      consecutive days in an earlier run of this script.
//   5. US SPELLINGS, both ways. The shared scripts/us-spellings.mjs screen
//      rejects a British answer (VOCAB is an off-the-shelf list and carries
//      armour, colour, theatre, and the answer is revealed to the player, so it
//      is reader-facing copy). The mirror matters just as much: if one of the
//      three HOTTEST words is merely the other spelling of the answer, the
//      board's best clue is an orthography lesson, so it is rejected too. That
//      is what dropped behavior (behaviour at #1), recognize (recognise),
//      organization (organisation), center (centre), labor and armor.
//
// CEILINGS ACROSS THE RUN (nothing in the verifier caps these; they are this
// generator's own, and they are what stops 62 boards of the same idea):
//   - domain: at most 5 boards of the 62 in any one semantic domain (~8%), and
//     no domain may repeat inside a rolling window of 7 days, so no two boards
//     in the same week share one;
//   - part of speech: at most 40 nouns, at least 8 verbs and 8 adjectives, at
//     most 4 boards in a row sharing a part of speech, and the picker steers
//     each day towards a 58/21/21 noun/verb/adjective split rather than
//     spending all its non-nouns early and then stalling on the run rule;
//   - word length: no single length on more than 18 of the 62 boards, and at
//     least 5 distinct lengths must appear;
//   - rank sub-band: each of the three weekday sub-bands takes at least 14 of
//     the 53 weekday boards, and each Sunday sub-band at least 2 of the 9.
// The run prints all of these counts at the end. If a ceiling cannot be met the
// script STOPS at that date and says which ceiling failed, rather than shipping
// a flatter bank to reach a date.
//
// FROZEN. The script never parses-and-reprints the existing file: it appends
// text after the last existing board's closing brace, so every byte before it
// is untouched by construction, and it refuses to run if the bank's last date
// is not the one it expects.
//
// STORED FORM. A board is written as `board({ …, o })`, where `o` is the
// ranking packed three base64 characters per vocab index by
// app/warmer/order-codec.js — NOT as an array of 32,300 numeric literals. That
// is not a cosmetic choice: the array form is 32,300 AST nodes per board, five
// server modules import this bank for its dates alone, and at 136 boards
// `next build` was SIGKILLed parsing it. Every board is decoded and compared
// against the array it came from before this script writes anything.
//
// DETERMINISM. mulberry32 seeded with SEED_BASE + the first new board number,
// so an unchanged run reproduces byte-identically and the new segment cannot
// replay the frozen one's choices.
//
// Run: node scripts/gen-warmer.mjs --reproduce   check the pipeline vs frozen
//      node scripts/gen-warmer.mjs               plan the run, write nothing
//      node scripts/gen-warmer.mjs --write       append to app/warmer/puzzles.js
//      node scripts/verify-warmer.mjs            must pass afterwards
//
// Cache lives in /tmp/build/warmer-* and is cleared at the start of every run
// except the vector cache, which is a pure function of the pinned package and
// so cannot bleed stale boards; --fresh-vectors rebuilds that too. NOTE that
// the clear deletes anything else you park under /tmp/build/warmer-*, scratch
// scripts included.
//
// WHAT LIMITS THE NEXT EXTENSION. Not the calendar and not the search — the
// SEMANTIC SPACE. Every banked answer permanently removes its rank-80
// neighbourhood from the pool for everyone after it, and 136 answers now sit in
// there. Going much past this will mean either accepting a narrower frozen
// floor (say 60, still above the frozen bank's median) or curating a pool of
// ordinary words in neighbourhoods nobody has used yet. Do NOT reach for
// abstractions like "approximately" or "whatsoever" to make a date: they pass
// every gate here and make a bad puzzle.
//
// The other wall is file size, and it has already been hit once. Written as
// numeric arrays the bank reached 25MB / 4.4 million AST nodes at 136 boards
// and `next build` was SIGKILLed; boards are now stored packed (96,900 chars
// each, ~13.2MB for 136 — see app/warmer/order-codec.js), which builds with
// room to spare at a 3GB heap. That buys roughly another year of daily boards
// at ~97KB each before the question comes back; past that the answer is per-day
// files loaded by app/warmer/page.js, so the module graph never holds them all.
