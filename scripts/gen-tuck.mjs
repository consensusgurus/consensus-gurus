//        Use --out PATH instead to write the rows to a file for inspection.
//   other flags: --seed N (default 20260930), --tries N (deals per day, default
//        20000), --premcap N (the per-letter premium ceiling; 99 measures the
//        natural pressure).
//
//   ALWAYS finish with `node scripts/verify-tuck.mjs`. It takes about 90 seconds
//   for 136 boards and it is the gate, not this script.
//
// WHAT A BOARD IS. A Tuck day is fourteen letters (fifteen on Sunday) and one
// number. The number is the whole contract: `benchmark = round(1.06 x the
// ladder solver's best line)`, where the ladder solver is the one in
// scripts/verify-tuck.mjs. So the generator's only unforgeable output is the
// rack; everything else is computed from it, twice — once here and once by the
// verifier, which is the gate.
//
// THE SOLVER IN HERE IS A MIRROR, NOT A SECOND OPINION. `ladder()` below
// reproduces scripts/verify-tuck.mjs's `ladder()` exactly — the same 2-to-8
// letter corpus from public/tuck-dict.txt, the same top-250 spines by points,
// the same two column orders, the same greedy first-fitting vertical, the same
// +10 for a full tuck. It is only ~100x faster (a rack costs ~12ms instead of
// ~1.2s), which is what makes a rejection-sampling search affordable at all.
// The speed comes from three things and nothing else:
//   * one pass per rack that computes each word's DEFICIT against the rack, so
//     `formable` and all 26 `nearFormable` lists fall out together (a word fits
//     rack+L exactly when its deficit is empty or is exactly {L:1});
//   * the dictionary pre-sorted once by points DESC then original index ASC,
//     which is byte-for-byte what `dict.filter(...).sort((a,b)=>b.p-a.p)`
//     produces under V8's stable sort, so no per-rack sorting is needed and the
//     greedy fill picks the same candidate the verifier picks;
//   * a letter-bitmask reject (`out & (out-1)`) that throws out ~95% of the
//     list in one integer test.
// If verify-tuck's solver ever changes, THIS MUST CHANGE WITH IT. The proof
// that they still agree is `--selfcheck`, which re-solves every rack already in
// the bank and diffs against the stored benchmark.
//
// WHAT MAKES A GOOD DAY (the part a machine has to be told). A legal rack is
// not a good rack. Four failure modes are real and all four are screened:
//
//   1. UNPLAYABLE / THIN. A rack the solver cannot get a line out of. Floors:
//      the solver line must land inside the band dealt to the day (below), and
//      the rack must form at least MIN_FORMABLE words over the verifier's
//      corpus. The thinnest rack ever banked (AAAUUUCFFHSVWW) forms 124, so 120
//      is a wall the shipped bank has already leaned on.
//   2. DOMINATED BY ONE WORD. If the single best word a player can find is most
//      of the day's score, the "build your own grid" game collapses into "spot
//      the anagram". Measured as dominance = topWordPoints / solverBest over
//      the FULL player dictionary (base + extra + long, which is what the client
//      validates against). The calibrated-era bank runs 0.289 to 0.489, median
//      0.362; the ceiling here is 0.44, i.e. stricter than what has shipped.
//   3. AN UNPLEASANT WORD AS THE OBVIOUS PLAY. See the next block.
//   4. A BENCHMARK THAT WILL NOT FIT ON THE BOARD. The verifier's solver counts
//      points and never asks whether its spine-plus-verticals shape fits in the
//      client's nine rows, and in the worst case it does not (two 8-letter
//      verticals crossing at their first and last letters want fifteen). This
//      generator only banks a rack whose best line is geometrically realisable.
//      Worth knowing: over the 15,345 deals of the shipping run it rejected
//      exactly ZERO racks — the greedy fill's verticals are short and cross near
//      their middles — so the gate is cheap insurance, not a live constraint.
//
// THE RUDE SCREEN. public/tuck-dict.txt was screened for slurs by EXACT MATCH
// (20 scrubbed 2026-07-18) and public/tuck-dict-extra.txt deliberately puts
// some of the mild casualties back for player validation, so the dictionary a
// player actually plays against still contains COCK, TITS, PRICK, SNATCH, MUFF,
// NUDE, POOP, and — an exact-match screen having missed the singular — WOG and
// GYP in the base file itself. None of that is a reason to touch the
// dictionaries: they are frozen because every bank verifier on the site reasons
// over them. It IS a reason to refuse racks that make one of those words the
// day's obvious best play. So a rack is refused when any of its top
// SCREEN_TOP highest-scoring plays over the player dictionary is screened, or
// when any word in the solver's own best line is screened. The list is stems +
// ordinary suffixes (never substrings — CLASS, TITLE and ASSIST are words),
// covering profanity, slurs, sexual and bodily terms, and the violence /
// clinical register a breakfast-table daily should not surface. `--probe`
// prints exactly which dictionary entries the screen catches, so it stays a
// real list rather than a theoretical one.
//
// THE RAMP. Sunday is the Sunday Edition: fifteen letters, 5-7 vowels (weekdays
// are fourteen and 4-6), and here also a higher floor on the solver line —
// SUNDAY_BANDS starts at 52 where WEEKDAY_BANDS starts at 46. That is a real
// step up: the shipped calibrated-era Sundays run as low as 46, i.e. no higher
// than a Tuesday.
//
// A FLOOR IS NOT A TARGET. Days are not simply accepted for clearing 46. Each
// day is dealt a target BAND from a deterministic, shuffled schedule with fixed
// proportions, and the rack must land INSIDE that band — a closed interval, so
// a day dealt 46-50 cannot be quietly satisfied with a 64. Bands and shares:
//   weekday  46-50 (32%) · 51-55 (32%) · 56-61 (26%) · 62-72 (10%)
//   sunday   52-57 (44%) · 58-63 (34%) · 64-76 (22%)
// The tops of both ladders are deliberately thin: a bag deal clears 62 about 4%
// of the time on a weekday and 64 about 5% on a Sunday, and every one of those
// racks is carrying a Q, a Z or an X. Widen the top band and the premium-letter
// ceiling below is the thing that breaks — that is not a coincidence, it is the
// variety trap arriving from the other direction.
//
// POOL VARIETY, enforced here and reported by --probe. Scope is the COMBINED
// bank (the frozen boards seed the duplicate sets through --avoid); the
// counting ceilings are scoped to the new run, which is the segment this script
// is responsible for:
//   * no rack repeats another rack as a multiset of letters                (0)
//   * no top word repeats another day's top word — over the whole 136-board
//     bank, not just this run                                              (0)
//   * the vowel/consonant split is SCHEDULED, not sampled: the three legal
//     weekday splits (4, 5 and 6 vowels) are dealt in equal thirds and so are
//     the three Sunday ones (5, 6, 7), then the schedule is reshuffled until no
//     count runs more than 3 days in a row across the merged calendar. Left to
//     the sampler this clusters badly: the same generator with the schedule off
//     dealt nine Sundays without a single 5-vowel rack among them.
//   * no single top-word LENGTH takes more than 30% of the new run
//   * per rack: at most 4 tiles worth 4+ points, at most 2 of J/Q/X/Z, at most
//     4 copies of a vowel and 3 of a consonant
//   * across the new run: at most 15 boards carrying each of J, Q, X and Z, and
//     17 carrying K (--premcap). A fair bag deals about 9 of each over 62
//     boards; the shipped bank drifted to the equivalent of 16 Z, 16 J and 19 K
//     because rerolling for a high solver line quietly rewards premium tiles,
//     and this generator's own uncapped probe run drifted to 21 Q. The cap
//     BINDS — J, Q and Z all finish the shipping run at exactly 15 — which is
//     what a ceiling is for. Raising it is the wrong lever if a future run runs
//     short; lower the top band instead.
//
// WHY BAG SAMPLING AND NOT LETTER-FREQUENCY SAMPLING. Racks are dealt from the
// real 98-tile Scrabble bag WITHOUT replacement, so duplicate letters are
// self-limiting and the racks read like deals rather than like a generator's
// idea of English. 64% of bag deals inside the vowel band already clear 45, so
// there is no need to tilt the bag toward premium letters — and tilting it is
// exactly how every rack starts to feel the same.
//
// DETERMINISM. One xorshift32 seeded with SEED offset by STARTNUM, so an
// unchanged run reproduces byte-identically and a segment starting at a
// different board number can never replay the frozen segment's deals.
//
// WHAT THE RUNWAY LOOKS LIKE. Nothing about the rack space runs out: the bag is
// memoryless, top-word collisions with the existing bank cost 8 deals in 15,345,
// and 62 boards take 26 seconds. What DOES bind is the premium-letter ceiling,
// because the top band and the ceiling pull against each other — J, Q and Z all
// finish this run exactly at 15. A longer run is fine (the ceilings scale with
// DAYS), but a run that also widens the top band is not. If a future extension
// fails to fill a day, read the per-day rejection line the failure prints: a
// `premium-cap` majority means the bands are too hot for the ceiling, and a
// `band` majority means the band itself is too narrow.
