# ---- proper-noun veto + a stricter bar for the shortest slots ----------------
# Two separate lessons, both learned the same way (owner rule, 2026-08-19):
#
#   1. A frequency floor does not mean "a word a reader knows" at short lengths.
#      Two-letter strings are inflated by abbreviations (st 5.20, from Street and
#      Saint) and by foreign text in an English corpus (ja 3.71, si 4.17), so 108
#      of the 124 two-letter words in tuck-dict.txt cleared zipf 3.5 and filled
#      grids with ST, JA, PE, KY. Three-letter slots are the same problem one size
#      up: ING, ONS, ENG, REC, TAE, ISH and HEH all clear 3.5.
#   2. wordfreq is case-insensitive, so first names score like common words
#      (dan 4.51, ted, lee). Only a case-sensitive dictionary can tell them apart.
#
# So: LEN2 is empty (no template has a two-letter slot any more, and an empty pool
# means a stray one could never be filled); length 3 must be a LOWERCASE entry in
# en_US.hunspell and clear a higher floor; every length drops words hunspell knows
# only as a capitalised proper noun. Lengths 4+ keep the ordinary 3.5 floor, whose
# tail (moth, avid, mesa, hive) is already ordinary English.
HUNSPELL = '/usr/share/hunspell/en_US.dic'
SHORT_LEN = 3          # the length that needs the dictionary check
SHORT_ZMIN = 4.0       # and the higher frequency floor
