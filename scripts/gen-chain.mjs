// Bank generator for Chain, the daily dots-and-boxes endgame.
//
// Positions are produced by SELF-PLAY from an empty board, never by sprinkling
// edges at random, so every board it emits is reachable by a real game and the
// chains and loops form the way they do in play. The walk plays safe edges (any
// edge that does not hand the opponent a box) while safe edges exist, taking
// captures along the way, which is exactly how a real game arrives at the
// chain endgame this puzzle is picked up in.
//
// A candidate is accepted only when all of these hold, all recomputed here from
// app/chain/boxes.js, the same engine the browser runs:
//
//   1. it is YOUR move, and you are winning: (mine - theirs) + value > 0;
//   2. EXACTLY ONE edge keeps the win. Every other edge on the board hands the
//      game to the engine, and there is no take-back;
//   3. BOTH temptations are live at the root: at least one box you could take
//      right now, and at least one quiet edge you could decline with. A board
//      that offers only one kind of move answers itself;
//   4. the board has an ODD number of boxes, so a tie is impossible;
//   5. the shipping solver answers the root inside the time budget, measured,
//      because the browser runs this same search once per turn.
//
// The bank ALTERNATES the shape of the answer, and that is deliberate. On even
// days the key is a quiet edge, so every capture on the board loses; on odd
// days the key is a capture, so the double-cross reflex is the mistake. Sundays
// are always a decline day. A bank where the answer is always "leave it alone"
// teaches players to win without reading the position, which is the pool-variety
// failure the authoring standard is about.
