// Lode — daily board generator.
//
// Lode is the open-ended letter hunt: seven letters, one CORE letter that every
// word must use, minimum four letters, letters reusable. A word using all seven
// is a PANGRAM.
//
// The Source of Truths twist is that points come from RARITY, not just length.
// Every scored word carries a tier derived from its real-world usage frequency
// (Zipf scale, computed offline by scripts/lode-words.py), so knowing one
// uncommon word beats grinding ten obvious ones:
//
//   base      = length - 2          (4 letters = 2 ... 8 letters = 6)
//   multiplier= 1 / 2 / 3           (common / uncommon / rare)
//   pangram   = +10
//
// The frequency data USED to double as the junk filter, and no longer does.
// As of 2026-08-17 there is NO frequency floor: every word in the shipped
// dictionaries (public/tuck-dict.txt for 4 to 8 letters, tuck-dict-long.txt for
// 9 to 15) is scored, except proper nouns, which scripts/lode-words.py vetoes
// with hunspell and which reach the player as tailings instead. Frequency now
// decides only the MULTIPLIER, not membership.
//
// Two holes closed on the way here, both of which reached players as "that is
// not a word": the 4-to-8 list was read alone until 2026-08-15, so no word of
// nine letters or more could appear on any board (BEGINNING, COHERENCE,
// INITIALLY, ABBREVIATE); and the floor itself was cutting ordinary vocabulary
// (rile, glob, clef, gild, dolt, kith, mien, riffraff, ogled) right up until it
// was removed.
//
// Each day carries a VEIN: the target score that counts the day as solved, set
// at a fixed share of the board's maximum. Ranks below it give the ladder
// something to climb, and MOTHER LODE (every word) is there for the obsessives.
//
// Usage:
//   python3 scripts/lode-words.py > scripts/.lode-freq.json   (once, or to refresh)
//   node scripts/gen-lode.mjs --from 2026-08-01 --days 400 > app/lode/puzzles.js
//
// Changing the word pool reshuffles the WHOLE bank, including boards already
// played, so a refresh regenerates future dates only and splices them under the
// boards that have gone live (--from tomorrow, --startnum after the last one).
//
// Regenerating is safe and idempotent: the day chosen for a given date is a
// pure function of the date seed, so re-running never reshuffles history.

// ─── tunables ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A junk floor scaled BY LENGTH was, for most of Lode's life, the only thing
// between a reader and the Scrabble tail. It was the wrong tool, and the reason
// is worth keeping: the dictionary is full of proper nouns (james, texas, paris,
// facebook), and a name is FREQUENT, so any floor high enough to stop names also
// stopped ordinary vocabulary nobody writes down (lard 2.98, howl 3.18, silt
// 2.96, coax 2.96, ruse 3.16). Frequency cannot tell "nobody knows it" from
// "nobody writes it"; only a dictionary can. The vocabulary gate therefore moved
// to hunspell in scripts/lode-words.py on 2026-07-30, the floor came down to 1.5
// once it no longer had to police names, and then came off entirely.
//
// THERE IS NO FREQUENCY FLOOR (owner call, 2026-08-17). A word needs four
// letters and to not be a proper noun; scripts/lode-words.py applies the second
// of those and nothing else. Every one of the 267,009 words it emits is scored.
// Do not reintroduce a floor here: this file used to hold a second gate that
// had to be kept in sync with the Python, and there is no longer anything to
// keep in sync.

// but they score at the BASE rate, and that branch is load-bearing rather than
// cosmetic: 0 is less than TIER_RARE, so without it every one of them would pay
// TREBLE. Measured, that took the median board's rare share from 0.25 to 0.49,
// i.e. half of every board would be a x3 word nobody knows, and memorising a
// Scrabble list would beat knowing real vocabulary — the exact inversion of
// what the rarity scoring exists to reward. With the branch, rare share sits at
// 0.28 and the treble still points at words a reader could actually place.

// How many words a board may hold. Raised from 46/70 on 2026-08-15 (owner call)
// in the same pass that lifted the pool's eight-letter cap: with nine- to
// fifteen-letter words finally in the data the pool went 28,779 -> 49,189, and
// holding the old ceiling would have spent that entirely on REJECTING the
// fuller boards rather than on giving players more to find. At 60/95 the
// average weekday board carries about 39 words and the Sunday about 64.
//
// Raised again to 70/110 on 2026-08-17 for the same reason, when the 1.5 floor
// took the pool to 67,300: the median candidate board grew to 60 words, so a
// 60 cap would have thrown away half the field. The rise is deliberately much
// smaller than the pool's, because the VEIN is a share of the board maximum and
// Lode has to close in a few minutes against two dozen other dailies.
//
// And again to 110/150 later the same day, when the floor was removed outright
// and the pool went to 267,009. A 7-letter set now builds 138 words on average,
// so the old 70 cap left only the sparsest letter sets eligible and biased the
// deal toward awkward boards. This IS a materially longer day than the morning's
// 70/110 (weekday vein 119 -> 170), which was the owner's explicit call when the
// floor came off: fuller, more representative boards over a shorter close.
//
// SUNDAY IS 120, NOT the ~170 the weekday:Sunday ratio would imply, and the
// verifier is what set it. The vein is a share of the board maximum, so a bigger
// Sunday needs proportionally MORE words before the day closes, and past a point
// that trips "needs N words at best to reach the vein — a grind". Measured over
// the whole bank: cap 170 -> 23 grind Sundays, 150 -> 15, 140 -> 7, 130 -> 6,
// 120 -> 1. So Sunday sits at 120 (~88 words against the weekday's ~71) and the
// bank ships with a single grind board rather than a third of its Sundays.
//
// The remaining warning is a consequence of the owner's fuller-board call, not a
// regression: the >26-word threshold was calibrated when a weekday board held
// ~39 words and the vein was ~106, and boards are now roughly 1.8x that. If
// bigger Sundays are wanted, the lever is VEIN_SHARE — close the day at a lower
// share of a larger maximum — NOT a higher cap. That changes the rank ladder for
// every board, so it is an owner decision.
//
// ⚠️ verify-lode.mjs writes warnings with console.WARN (stderr). A sweep that
// redirects 2>/dev/null counts zero warnings at every cap and looks like a clean
// result; that mistake picked 150 here before it was caught. Capture 2>&1.
