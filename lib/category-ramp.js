// THE CATEGORY RAMP: one colour per daily-game category, and the only place
// a stage, a stage CTA or a stage ladder gets its colour from.
//
// WHY A RAMP AND NOT THE REGISTRY HUES. Every game in lib/daily-games.js
// carries its own `color`, and those were each chosen once, for one game,
// against a navy slate row. As a SET they collide: Atlas #4ade9c and Biz
// #4fbf8b are both mid green and worse in their light values. The Gauntlet run
// hit this first and answered it with a run-local ramp (LADDER_RAMP in
// lib/circuits.js), cool to warm, every step a high-lightness pastel carrying
// dark ink. This is that answer generalised from one run to the whole roster.
//
// THREE COLOUR SYSTEMS, DELIBERATELY INDEPENDENT (owner, 2026-08-30). This is
// the note to read before "fixing" any of what follows, because every part of
// it looks like an inconsistency and none of it is:
//
//   * RAMP order is IDENTITY and is CANONICAL. This file. It cannot be per
//     user, because a game page is server-rendered and cannot read a browser's
//     preference, so a user-ordered ramp would paint every stage the wrong
//     colour until hydration and then repaint it.
//   * SHELF order is PRESENTATION and is PER USER. CAT_ORDER in
//     app/today/TodayClient.jsx, hand-draggable, stored under `sot_cat_order`.
//     It MAY disagree with the ramp order, and the owner has ruled that it may.
//     Heat climbing this file's order and the reader's own page running in a
//     different order is an accepted outcome, not a bug to chase.
//   * CAT_BLUE in lib/home-blues.js is the HOME's band colour and it is a
//     separate table with separate rules (4.5:1 on white, neighbours 30 degrees
//     apart), because a filled band on the home is a different problem from a
//     pastel fill on a near-black stage. The ramp is NOT required to reproduce
//     its progression. Measured, the two sit a mean of 70 degrees apart in hue,
//     so most categories read as one colour on the home tile and another on
//     their own page. That was weighed and accepted.
//
// So: reorder your shelves all you like, and do not reach for a reassignment
// that makes these tables rhyme. If that is ever wanted, it is a pure
// permutation of the ten values below, no new colours, and it takes the mean
// gap to 35 degrees. It is a decision, not a cleanup.
//
// SUDOKU IS A CATEGORY, as of 2026-09-01. It was a browsing shelf the home
// split out of Numbers while the nine grids stayed `cat: 'Numbers'` in the
// registry, so they took the Numbers step on their own pages and the shelf and
// the stage disagreed. They are `cat: 'Sudoku'` now and carry their own step,
// which is what the home's CAT_ORDER had already been listing them as.
//
// THE TENTH STEP COST THE QUIZ ITS ACCENT, and that trade is the thing to know
// before moving either. Periwinkle was the ONE hue no daily category wore,
// which is exactly why lib/quiz-stage.js had taken it: measured, the only two
// gaps on this ramp wider than 60 degrees are the green at ~119 and the
// periwinkle at ~230, and the green one dies on the light register, where Logic
// is already green at 137 and Numbers at 163. So there was one slot, the quiz
// held it, and Sudoku took it. The quiz accent moved to a neutral slate rather
// than to another hue, because after this there is no hue left further than 28
// degrees from a category. An ELEVENTH category means either widening that
// rule or accepting a near-collision; it is not a free step.

// ONE INK FOR EVERY STEP OF THE DARK RAMP. Each colour there is a

// better; scripts/verify-category-ramp.mjs proves that rather than trusting

// strength. Declared here, above the light ramp, because the light ramp's ink
// table reuses it for the three steps that stay pastel.
export const RAMP_INK = '#08222e';

// THE SAME TEN HUES, ONE STEP DEEP, for a pale ground.
//
// A pastel fill cannot carry on white: it is nearly the ground. So the light
// register keeps the HUES, which are what say which category this is, and
// takes them down to a value that carries WHITE ink instead of dark. That is
// the only difference between the two ramps, and it is why a category is
// recognisably itself in either.
//
// scripts/verify-category-ramp.mjs proves both sets rather than trusting this.
// WHY THE LIGHT TWINS ARE DARK, since the switch is the first thing anyone
// asks: the accent CARRIES WHITE TEXT (RAMP_INK_LIGHT below), so on a pale
// ground each step has to be dark enough to hold it. The dark register is the
// mirror — a pale step on a near-black page. Same hue, opposite end.
//
// That constraint is also the trap: a 700-weight is not automatically a good
// colour. Lime's was #4d7c0f, which is olive rather than lime and was the one
// step on the ramp that looked wrong (owner, 2026-08-31). When replacing one,
// keep white above 4.5:1 and keep it distinct from its NEIGHBOURS on the ramp.
// WHY THE LIGHT TWINS ARE DARK, since the switch is the first thing anyone
// asks: the accent CARRIES WHITE TEXT (RAMP_INK_LIGHT below), so on a pale
// ground each step must be dark enough to hold it. The dark register is the
// mirror — a pale step on a near-black page. Same hue, opposite end.
//
// LOGIC IS THE ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION (owner, 2026-08-31). Lime made dark
// enough for white text is OLIVE — that is inherent to a dark yellow-green, not
// a bad pick — and the owner would rather have two different colours than a
// muddy one. So Logic is lime on the dark register and GREEN on the light one,
// 55 degrees apart, and scripts/verify-category-ramp.mjs exempts it by name.
// Do not "fix" the mismatch: it was chosen. Every other step stays same-hue.
// THE WARM STEPS DO NOT DARKEN, THEY FLIP THEIR INK (owner, 2026-08-31). The
// rule above -- take the hue down until it holds WHITE text -- works for seven of
// the ten and produces a BROWN for the other three, because gold, amber and
// orange have nowhere darker to go. #a16207 was End Game's, and on a light page
// the whole curtain, the Share card and every accent chip read brown. Logic had
// already hit the same wall from the green end and was answered by changing the
// colour; the owner's answer here is better and generalises: keep the hue AND
// the value, and change the INK instead. A gold band with near-black text is
// exactly what the dark register renders, and it is gold on either page.
//
// The cost, and it was weighed: a pastel fill on a pale ground is only about
// 1.7:1 against it, so a warm accent chip has a soft EDGE in light mode where a
// cool one has a hard one. The text on it is 8:1 and up, which is the contrast
// that carries meaning, and verify-category-ramp.mjs states this rather than
// silently exempting it.

// THE ACCENT WHEN IT IS TEXT ON PAPER, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME COLOUR AS THE

// as a GROUND carrying RAMP_INK_LIGHT, and seven of the ten happen to read as
// text on the pale register's own ground as well. The three that carry DARK ink
// are pastels, and a pastel is exactly the thing that cannot be text on paper:
// measured against --stg-ground (#eef1f6), gold is 1.68:1, orange 2.00 and
// amber 1.47. That is what the reader means by "does not work on Light mode":

// masthead, the "You Nth" rank chip and the game's own status line were all
// painted in it (owner report, 2026-09-02).
//
// So the accent has two jobs and now two values. --stg-acc stays the FILL and
// nothing about it moves; --stg-acc-ink is the TEXT, published per game beside
// it, and on the DARK register the two are the same value because a pastel on

 * a different colour arguing with it. Worse, Garble had already half-converted
 * — the marked tile's FILL was var(--stg-acc) while every border beside it
 * stayed literal gold, so a sky tile sat inside a gold ring.
 *
 * So both states are the category step, two values deep. STRONG is --stg-acc
 * itself, which means the pair follows a category without an edit here and is
 * correct on both registers by construction: sky #7dd3fc with near-black ink on
 * the dark stage, deep sky #0369a1 with white ink on the light one.
 *
 * SOFT is that same hue mixed back toward the ground, so "spoken for, but not
 * home" reads as the SAME thing one step weaker rather than as a second colour.
 * Its ink is --stg-ink, not --stg-onramp: a mix that is mostly ground is
 * carried by the ground's own ink, and --stg-onramp is only guaranteed against
 * the step at full strength. Measured at 48%: 4.7:1 on the dark register,

 * resolve per register at PAINT time rather than per game at render time, and
 * only a var() can do that. The fallbacks are what an off-stage (?stage=0) Loft
 * page resolves to, so a caller needs no STAGE branch. They are exported from
 * here, rather than declared in each client, because two games have to agree
 * about them and two hand-kept copies of a colour is how a pair drifts.
 *
 * A caller wanting the pair as data (a share card, an OG image) should read the
