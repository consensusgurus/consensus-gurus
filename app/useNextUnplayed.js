// The game to offer after a finish: the first unplayed daily in the SAME
// category as the one just finished, falling back to the first unplayed of any
// category. Needs no new endpoint, since the daily registry and the played map
// both already exist.
//
// `perGame` marks an abandoned run as well as a finished one, and an abandon is
// not a completion, so the played test mirrors DailyGamesGrid exactly:
// played === entry exists AND it is not flagged abandoned. Getting this wrong
// would offer a player a game they are midway through as if it were new.
//
// Fetched fresh: the cached daily-me answer can predate the finish that just
// happened on this page, which is the case dailyMeClient's own comment warns of.
//
// A FAMILY OUTRANKS A CATEGORY (owner, 2026-09-04). Parker, Impound and Junkyard
// are one puzzle at three fixed sizes, so finishing any of them should hand the
// player the next SIZE they have not played, not merely another Logic game. The
// ladder lives in GAME_FAMILIES in lib/daily-games.js and is read here through
// familyAfter(), which returns the rest of the family cyclically from the rung
// after the one just finished, so the offer always moves forward and wraps.
// Every other daily is in no family, familyAfter returns [], and the category
// rule below is untouched.
//
// Use DAILY_GAMES, the EXPORTED registry, which also drops retired games. The
// first cut imported ALL_DAILY_GAMES, which is module-private, so the import was
// undefined, .find threw inside the .then, and the catch swallowed it: the row
// simply never appeared. Hence the catch now logs instead of going quiet.
