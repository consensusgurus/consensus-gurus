// Shared client for /api/quiz/daily-me (2026-08-01).
//
// WHY: three independent components ask the same question on one daily puzzle
// page — the end card, DailyBoardPanel and DailyGamesGrid — and each was
// "self-contained", so each fired its own request. A live load measured FIVE
// daily-me requests (the card retries until its own row lands, on top of the
// other two). They are parallel, so the wall-clock cost is small, but it is the
// same answer computed several times per page view.
//
// This is a one-entry cache, not a store: a caller asking the same question
// within a few seconds joins the request already in flight instead of starting
// another. It deliberately keeps no long-lived state, because a daily board
// genuinely changes as people play.
//
// The end card passes { fresh: true } on every attempt: it is checking for its
// OWN just-written row, so it must never be served a cached answer. Its result
// still SEEDS the entry, which is what lets the panel and the grid ride along on
// the request the card was already making.

const TTL_MS = 4000;
// How long a fresh caller may join a fresh request that is STILL IN FLIGHT.
// Short on purpose: it is meant to catch two components mounting in the same
// tick, never to serve an answer that predates something written since.
const JOIN_MS = 400;

let entry = null; // { key, at, promise, fresh, pending }

// The query string every caller should build, so identical questions produce
// identical keys. `game` scopes the full scoring to one puzzle; without it the
// endpoint only counts rows, which is all the grid needs.

  // It may NOT join one that has SETTLED, which is the whole reason `fresh`
  // exists: the card's retry loop is looking for its OWN just-written row, and

  // join across a finish, since DailyEndCard calls invalidateDailyMe() on
