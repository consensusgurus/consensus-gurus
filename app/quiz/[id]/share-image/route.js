// This used to render renderQuizQuestionCard for company quizzes: the first
// question plus its four choices, with the company's favicon fetched from
// Google at render time. Both are gone. The favicon was a network round trip
// inside an image route for a 60px decoration, and at the ~600px a timeline
// actually renders, four 26px choice chips are unreadable — the whole card
// spent on content that gives nothing away. The title, set large, does more.
