// The quiz end card, in the daily puzzles' Loft format.
//
// It is a thin adapter, not a second end card: everything it renders comes out
// of the shared <LoftFinish>, the same component all 65 dailies flip to. The
// point of the exercise is that a player finishing a quiz and a player
// finishing a daily land on the SAME object, so anything that improves one
// improves the other. Nothing here restates a rule that lives in LoftFinish.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN COMPONENT AND NOT A BLOCK INSIDE QuizClient. The card
// needs two hooks, useIqStanding and useDayStats, and useDayStats has no
// `active` gate: it fires its fetch the moment it mounts. Calling it in
// QuizClient would put one extra request on every one of the ~1,200 quiz page
// loads, whether or not the player ever finishes. A child that is mounted only
// once the round is over pays for it only when the card is actually shown, and
// hooks cannot be called conditionally, so a child is the only way to get that.
//
// It also keeps the diff in QuizClient (2,249 lines) down to the flip wrapper.
//
// THREE THINGS A QUIZ DOES NOT HAVE, and how each is handled rather than left
// to print a dash:
//   * an ARCHIVE. A daily has a bank of dated puzzles; a quiz is one board.
//     `archive` is omitted, so LoftFinish renders no archive button.
//   * a DAY. The four day tiles are daily-shaped (today's board, this game all
//     time, category today, day streak). The quiz passes its own three through
//     the `dayTiles` prop instead.
//   * a MISS COLUMN. Quizzes count nothing against you, so `missLabel` is
//     omitted and the board renders score and time only.
// The IQ bar is NOT one of them: IQ Points are site-wide and a quiz banks them
// exactly as a daily does, so useIqStanding and useDayStats are the same reads
// here as there.
