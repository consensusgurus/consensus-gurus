// THE EXPLICIT POINTER AT THE LIGHT SWITCH (owner, 2026-09-01).
//
// Two quieter pointers already existed and neither one ever says the words. The
// ring (useThemeHint) says only "there is a control here"; the first-load flip
// (useThemeIntro) shows what it DOES without naming it, and both are over in a
// few seconds. A reader who is not watching the cap at second one gets nothing
// from either. So a first-time reader now also gets this: a bubble under the
// glyph that names the register, points at the switch with an arrow, and
// carries the switch itself so they never have to find the icon at all.
//
// IT OFFERS THE REGISTER THE READER IS NOT IN, and that flipped with the
// default on 2026-09-01. The site opens light now, so the button writes 'dark';
// when it opened dark the same button wrote 'light'. The bubble's JOB is the
// sentence in the middle, which is register-neutral and says what the control
// is and where it lives, so the button is the demonstration rather than the
// point, exactly as the retired first-load flip was.
//
// IT IS A SIBLING OF THE SWITCH INSIDE THE CAP, not a portal to <body> and not
// position:fixed. Three reasons, in the order they cost something to learn:
//
//   1. THE PALETTE IS SCOPED TO .stage-page. Every --stg-* token is declared on
//      that element, and each client publishes its category accent as an inline
//      --stg-acc-dk / --stg-acc-lt on it, so a node portalled to <body> would
//      inherit none of them and would have to re-read them with
//      getComputedStyle and republish them as inline vars. A child of the cap
//      simply has them, in whichever register the reader is in.
//   2. NO CAP IS STICKY, so a fixed bubble would come away from the glyph on
//      the first scroll and need a scroll listener to chase it. An absolutely
//      positioned child of the cap scrolls with it for free.
//   3. It cannot live INSIDE the switch the way the flip's name chip does
//      (.stg-tlab, which gets away with it by being pointer-events:none): this
//      one holds buttons, and a button inside a button is invalid markup and
//      would fire the toggle on its way through.
//
// THE POSITION IS MEASURED, never written per cap. The three caps carry
// different paddings (20 / 22 / 22px) and the home's cap becomes a grid under
// 700px, so a constant would be wrong on two surfaces and wrong again on a
// phone. Measure the cap and the glyph, subtract, done.
//
// Mount it as the LAST CHILD of the cap. It reads its own parent to find the
// switch, so no ref is threaded through any cap and it takes no props.
