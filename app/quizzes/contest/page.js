    ['An email is required', 'Your Mind Loft account must have an email on it. Without one we cannot contact you, confirm the account is yours, or pay you, so accounts with no email are not ranked on the contest board. You can add one at any time before the deadline and your existing referrals still count.'],
    ['How to enter', 'Share your invite link. Anyone who opens it and finishes a game or a quiz is credited to you, once. You can find your link on the contest board below or from any Share button on the site.'],
    ['How scoring works', `${COPY.formulaLine}. Sessions are the separate days a person you referred came back and finished something, counted up to ${CONTEST.SESSION_CAP} days each. Plays are the games they finished, counted up to ${CONTEST.PLAY_CAP} each. Both caps are per person, so a large number of genuine new players always outranks a small number of very active ones.`],
    ['Existing referrals count', 'Everyone already on the community leaderboard starts with the score their existing referrals have earned. Nothing resets to zero. Your carried-in score is shown separately from what you earn during the contest, so you can see exactly where your total came from.'],
    ['One credit per person', 'Each person you bring in counts once, however much they play. Re-sending your link to the same person does not earn a second credit.'],
    ['Prizes', `First place wins $${CONTEST.prizes[0]}. Second and third each win $${CONTEST.prizes[1]}.`],
    ['How winners are paid', `Winners are sent a payout link and choose how to receive it from the options available in their country, which usually include ${CONTEST.payoutOptions.join(', ')}. ${CONTEST.payoutUsOnly.join(' and ')} is available in the US. Not every method is offered in every country, and prizes are paid in US dollars or the local equivalent at the prevailing rate.`],
    ['Deadline', `Entries close ${CONTEST.deadlineLabel}. The board is final at that moment. Winners are contacted by email within a few days after.`],
    ['Ties', 'If two entrants finish on the same score, the one who reached it first wins.'],
    ['Disqualification', 'Referrals are reviewed before any payout. Accounts created to refer yourself, duplicate or spoofed accounts, bots, and automated play are all disqualified, and a disqualified entrant forfeits the whole entry rather than just the affected referrals. This judgement is ours and is final.'],
    ['Changes', 'If the contest has to be changed or ended early, that will be posted on this page.'],
