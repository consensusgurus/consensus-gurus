// /sitemap.xml — the SITEMAP INDEX.
//
// Replaced the `app/sitemap.js` metadata convention on 2026-08-17. That convention emits a
// single flat <urlset>, which is what this site had: 2,511 urls in one 457KB file. Search
// Console reports index coverage PER SITEMAP, so one file could only ever report "130 of
// 2,511 indexed" and never say which kind of page was failing, when the answer (quizzes and
// lists, both shipping empty shells) was the whole story. Four segments report separately.
//
// It also stopped 1,852 static quiz urls from diluting the crawl signal on the ~64 game urls
// that genuinely change daily, which are the only pages currently earning search traffic.
//
// The old hosts are NOT served from here: middleware rewrites their /sitemap.xml to
// app/legacy-sitemap, which stays a single flat file of OLD urls on purpose (see that file).
//
// Segment list comes from SITEMAP_SEGMENTS, so adding a segment there adds it here too.
