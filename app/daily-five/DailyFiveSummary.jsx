// /daily-five — where a run ends (owner, 2026-08-17).
//
// A player who opts into a circuit should not be handed five ordinary end
// cards. Each of those is a full page of its own: an IQ hero, rank tiles, a
// share bar, "up next", "easiest leaderboard", the whole of today's slate, a
// popular quiz per category and a footer. Five of them in a row is the same
// furniture five times, and every one of them points AWAY from the run the
// player is in the middle of. So during a run the end card collapses to a
// verdict and a Next control (see the run branch in LoftFinish), and the
// summary they would otherwise have got arrives ONCE, here, at the end.
//
// IT SERVES EVERY CIRCUIT (owner, 2026-08-18). /daily-five is the marquee and
// /daily-five?circuit=<id> is one of the skill circuits: the same page,
// narrowed by the same query the board route already takes. A second page
// component for circuits would be a mirror of this one that has to be kept in
// step by hand, which is the failure this file warns about everywhere else.
//
// IT WEARS THE RUN CARD (owner, 2026-08-28). It used to draw a navy header
// block with the figures inside it, a board, and a column of per-game cards,
// while the Gauntlet run drew a white scorecard with a rail of per-game chips
// across the top. Two endings for the same event, kept in step by hand. Both
// render <CircuitScorecard/> now: the rail, then one card carrying the
// eyebrow, the headline, the figures, one row per game, the board and the
// actions. This file's only job is to turn what the server recorded into that
// component's props.
//
// It is a normal URL, so it is also the run's permalink: shareable, revisitable,
// and reachable without finishing (a half-done run renders honestly, with the
// unplayed games as open rows carrying a Play control).
