// PaperSkin — the "whitewash": the One Surface treatment applied ON TOP of an
// existing page rather than as a replacement for it.
//
// WHY IT IS A SKIN AND NOT A REWRITE. The alternative was a second copy of each
// page in the new look, which is the arrangement this repo has been bitten by
// repeatedly (see the mirror notes in CLAUDE.md: getSources and its three
// mirrors, buildLeaderboard and scoreGame, LoftFinish as a fifth mirror). Two
// renders of one page drift within a week. This is one render with a colour
// layer over it, so the page keeps a single source of truth for its markup and
// its behaviour, and the skin can be deleted in one commit.
//
// INERT UNLESS SWITCHED ON. Every rule below is scoped to `html.paper-skin`, so
// a page that mounts this component and does NOT get the flag renders byte for
// byte what it renders today. That is the property that makes it safe to mount
// on a live page.
//
// NOT VIEWABLE BY THE PUBLIC. The switch is `?paper=1`, the same review-flag
// convention `?loft=1` already uses (app/useLoft.js): live at the real URL,
// reachable only by someone who knows the parameter, and carried by no link on
// the site. It changes no metadata, so the canonical URL and everything a
// crawler reads stay exactly as they are.
//
// NO CLIENT COMPONENT, AND NO FLASH. useLoft reads its parameter in an effect
// and documents the cost: the page paints the old chrome for one frame first.
// That is tolerable for chrome and would be ugly for a whole ground colour, so
// this does it with a tiny inline script that runs during parse, before the
// browser paints anything below it. The stylesheet is always present and simply
// matches nothing, which is why no hydration boundary is involved at all.
//
// WHAT THE WHITEWASH ACTUALLY DOES, in the order a reader meets it:
//   1. the navy body, html and safe-area strip become the light ground
//   2. the masthead stops being a navy slab and becomes a white bar with a rule
//   3. the circuit's own navy header block loses its slab entirely and becomes
//      an identity line: a 4px accent rule, dark type, figures on the ground
//   4. every colour that was chosen to sit ON navy (the pale blues) is re-inked
//      for a light ground
//   5. NavyFrame's footer override is undone, so the shared footer goes back to
//      its own near-black ink
//
// THE ONE REAL COST, and it is not cosmetic: `body { background: var(--accent) }`
// in globals.css is what colours the iPhone status-bar dome, and that comment
// calls it load-bearing. Whitewashing the body necessarily lightens the dome and
// the Safari address bar on a skinned page. That is the honest consequence of a
// light ground and it is the thing to look at on a real phone before this rolls
// out past a preview.

// Runs during parse, so the class is on <html> before anything below it paints.

// hydrates and reconciles <html> (app/layout.js renders `<html lang="en">` with
// no className of its own) and the class is gone. The page was still navy by
