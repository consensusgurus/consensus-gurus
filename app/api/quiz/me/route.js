// Per-identity CDN cache (2026-08-08, Vercel cost fix).
//
// WHY: this route was 100% origin at ~2.6K calls and 27 MINUTES of function CPU
// per 12h, the single largest compute line on the account. The identity IS the
// query string (anonId / email / light / history), so a cache entry can never
// be served to a different player. That is the same argument
// /api/quiz/daily-status and /api/quiz/board already make for themselves.
//
// ONLY ANONYMOUS PLAYERS ARE CACHED (owner rule, 2026-08-08). A REGISTERED
// player always gets a live read, full stop. Their stats are the product they
// signed up for: rank, IQ Points and the Stat Hub have to be right the moment
// they look, not within two minutes. So the cache is a pure win on guests, who
// have no standing to track, and is never allowed to make a member's own
// numbers lag. Measured on the day this shipped: 42% of plays were anonymous,
// so the cache still absorbs a large share of the load.
//
// Two more carve-outs, both for correctness rather than policy:
//
// `fresh=1` opts OUT. This is what keeps the ANONYMOUS end card exact: a guest
// finishes a puzzle, the card reads this route immediately after POSTing the
// result row, and a stale profile would report zero IQ earned and swallow the
// trophy unlock. Registered players are uncached anyway, so the flag is belt
// and braces for them and load-bearing for guests.
//
// A `found: false` answer is NEVER cached. A brand-new player's first row can
// land mid-window, and caching the miss would tell them they do not exist for
// another 30 seconds.

// GET /api/quiz/me?anonId=&email=&light=
// The current player's full XP profile + activity, resolved by the identity the
// quiz client stores in localStorage (email -> u:<id>, else anon -> a:<anon>).
// Includes the trophy case (minus the duels group: the quiz_duels tally is a
// per-view query this hot path skips; /api/quiz/player carries it).
//
// `light=1` returns the headline profile ONLY: level, activity, ranks, base and
// byCategory, with an empty `recent` and no `trophies`. Those two are the whole
// cost of this route (the per-play rank-movement simulation needs rankFor, and
// the trophy pass re-walks every row), and the surfaces that call it on page
// load, starting with the /quizzes homepage player bar, render neither. It is
// also why light is fast for EVERYONE: with no rankFor it shares one memo entry
// across all players, so the first request of a row-version pays and the rest
// are a map lookup. Callers that show the activity log or the trophy case
// (Stat Hub, player profile, the post-game unlock toast) simply omit the flag.
//
// `history=1` is the MIDDLE mode, added 2026-08-08 for the ~47 daily-game
// clients. They call this route on mount for exactly two things: `recent`, fed
// to mergeServerStats for the cross-device stats/streak merge, and the name +
// IQ rank for the player chip. They read no trophies and no per-entry rank
// movement. Full mode was handing them both: `rankFor` pushes the result into
// the perPlayer memo (cap 4, so with real concurrency it thrashed to a ~0% hit
// rate) and the trophy pass re-walks every row. history keeps `recent` intact
// and drops only those two, which moves all 47 clients onto the SHARED memo
// entry every player reuses. Same bytes the clients actually consume, a
// fraction of the CPU.
