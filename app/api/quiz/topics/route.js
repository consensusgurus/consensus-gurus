// GET /api/quiz/topics -> { topics: [{ id, label, count,
//   quizzes: [{ id, title, n, t, mcq }] }] }
//
// `n` is how many things the quiz asks for and `t` its clock in seconds, both
// omitted when they are zero so the payload only grows by what is real. They
// exist for /quizzes, which prints a tagline under every tile in the SITE OWN
// words -- the quiz cap says "24 answers" and an mcq client says "questions",
// and `mcq` is which of those two this quiz will say. Without them a tile can
// only repeat the title in smaller type.
//
// The quiz catalogue grouped by department, for the home's expandable Quizzes
// section (app/today/StageToday.jsx).
//
// IT IS THE SAME SET AND THE SAME GROUPING AS /quizzes/all, deliberately.
// catalogQuizzes() (lib/quiz-catalog.js) is the helper the sitemap and the full
// index both derive from, and quizDept is the one department map, so the home
// and the index cannot disagree about what is in Geography or quietly drop a
// quiz between them. Never re-inline either filter here.
//
// IT IS A ROUTE RATHER THAN A PROP because lib/quizzes.js is 4.4MB of source
// and both surfaces that render the section are client components: importing
// QUIZZES into StageToday would put the whole catalogue in the /today bundle
// for a section most readers never open. Nothing in the payload depends on the
// request or on the database, so it is generated at build time and served from
// the edge, and the client fetches it once, only when the section comes into
// view.
//
// NEWEST FIRST INSIDE A TOPIC, not alphabetical. The home shows a peek of a
// dozen or so before "show all", and an alphabetical peek is the same handful
// of titles beginning with A every single day. /quizzes/all stays alphabetical,
// which is the right order for an index you are scanning for a known title.
// BUILT AT BUILD TIME, exactly as /quizzes/all is. That page is a server
// component with no dynamic export, so it is statically generated too, which
// means both surfaces show the catalogue as of the last deploy and a quiz
// banked for a future date appears on both at the same moment: the next push.
// Keep the two the same. A dynamic route here would show a banked quiz on the
// home before the index it links to had it.
