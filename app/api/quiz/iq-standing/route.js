// paid, what the player has banked today, and their slot in the global IQ
// ranking with `span` players above and below.
//
// Per-player, so it is never CDN-cached — but it reads the same in-process
// quiz_results cache every other stats route uses, so the marginal cost over
// /api/quiz/daily-combined (already fetched by the same card) is the ranking
// sort, not another table scan.
//
// `gained` is deliberately NULL until the just-finished /api/quiz/result row is
// visible. The card POSTs that row as it mounts, so the first read here often
// predates it; reporting null lets the client retry instead of showing the
// PREVIOUS game's number as if it were this one. Identify the row by exact
// `quizId` when the caller knows it, else by `game` (the daily key) matched
// against today's Eastern date — daily quizIds are `<key>-<M>-<D>-<YY>` and no
// daily key is a prefix of another, so the prefix match is unambiguous.
