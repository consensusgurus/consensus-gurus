// Shared client for /api/quiz/me (2026-08-08).
//
// WHY: every daily game page asks this question TWICE, for the same player, in
// the same tick. QuizNavHeader (on all 35 game surfaces, directly or through
// DailyChrome) wants the headline profile, so it asks for `light=1`. The game
// client wants the play history for the cross-device stats/streak merge, so it
// asks for `history=1`. Neither knows the other exists. Measured on a warm
// /crux load they were the two slowest things on the page at 1182ms and 836ms,
// and members are deliberately never CDN-cached (see the route header), so both
// go all the way to the origin and re-derive the same scoreboard.
//
// This coalesces them: callers landing in the same short window share ONE
// request, issued at the RICHEST mode anybody asked for.
//
// Upgrading is safe because the modes are nested supersets. `history` returns
// every field `light` does and adds `recent`; the full profile adds trophies and
// per-entry rank movement on top of that. So a light caller handed a history
// payload strictly gains. Verified before shipping that the only light consumer,
// QuizCommandHeader, reads just found / signed / name / xp / rank / ranks.xp /
// totalPlayers, and never touches `recent` or `trophies`.
//
// When only light callers turn up, the request STAYS light, so a page with no
// game client never pays for history it will not render.
//
// A `fresh=1` caller is never coalesced and never served from the settled entry.
// That is the post-game path reading its own just-written row, and handing it a
// shared answer from 40ms ago would report the pre-game IQ and swallow the
// trophy unlock.
//
// Call sites keep their exact shape: meRequest resolves to a `{ json() }`
// stand-in, so `meRequest(url).then((r) => r.json())` behaves like the plain
// fetch it replaced. That is deliberate, it keeps the diff across ~47 game
// clients to one token per file.

// Long enough to catch two components mounting in the same commit, short enough
// that nobody perceives it. The header's own request is delayed by this much.
const WINDOW_MS = 50;
// A late third caller can join an answer that just settled. Kept short because
// the only thing that changes a player's profile is finishing a game, and every
// post-game reader passes fresh=1 and bypasses this entirely.
